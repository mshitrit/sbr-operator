# SBD Operator

A Kubernetes operator for managing STONITH Block Device (SBD) configurations and remediations for high-availability clustering. The operator provides automated node remediation when nodes become unresponsive by leveraging shared block storage for fencing operations.

## Overview

The SBD operator implements a cloud-native approach to Storage-Based Death (SBD) for Kubernetes environments where traditional out-of-band management (IPMI, iDRAC) is unavailable. It uses shared block storage to provide reliable node fencing capabilities, ensuring data consistency and preventing split-brain scenarios in stateful workloads.

## Architecture

The operator consists of two main components:

- **SBD Operator**: Manages `SBDConfig` and `SBDRemediation` custom resources and deploys the SBD agent
- **SBD Agent**: Runs as a DaemonSet on cluster nodes, handling local watchdog operations and shared storage communication

### Key Features

- **Shared Storage Fencing**: Uses CSI block PVs with concurrent multi-node access for inter-node communication
- **Dual Watchdog System**: Combines shared storage watchdog with local kernel watchdog for robust failure detection
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Native CRDs for configuration management and remediation requests
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Built-in monitoring and observability
- **Split-Brain Prevention**: Shared storage arbitration ensures cluster consistency

## Custom Resources

### SBDConfig
Defines the SBD configuration for the cluster:
- Shared block device PVC name
- Timeout settings
- Watchdog device path
- Node exclusion lists
- Reboot methods

### SBDRemediation
Triggers node remediation operations:
- Target node specification
- Remediation status tracking
- Integration with Medik8s Node Healthcheck Operator

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster with CSI driver supporting `volumeMode: Block`
- Shared block storage with concurrent multi-node access (e.g., Ceph RBD, cloud provider shared volumes)
- Cluster nodes with kernel watchdog support

### Installation

1. Install the operator:
```bash
make deploy
```

2. Create an SBDConfig:
```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/medik8s_v1alpha1_sbdconfig.yaml
```

### Development

Build and test locally:
```bash
# Build the operator
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Run e2e tests
make test-e2e

# Build and push images
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<your-registry>/sbd-operator:tag
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:

- [Design Document](docs/design.md) - Architecture and design principles
- [Blueprint](docs/blueprint.md) - Detailed implementation blueprint
- [User Guide](docs/sbdconfig-user-guide.md) - Configuration and usage
- [Webhook Requirements](docs/WEBHOOK-REQUIREMENTS.md) - Admission webhook setup

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: `make test`
- **E2E Tests**: `make test-e2e`

E2E tests run against a deployed operator and verify functionality end-to-end.
